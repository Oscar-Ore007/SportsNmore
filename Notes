#github   steps when saving your code during your rproject 

1. git add .  
2. git commit -m "some message goes here highlighting what youdid 
3. git push origin master 


Thing I need to   do for this project 

1. Must be at least two levels deep. 
2. Must use  scrapper or an API 
3. Get the information from the API and send save it into objcets 

Steps on how to achieve this. 

1. Pick an API (Sportsdata API ) 

# url = "https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/players?per_page=100" 

This is the code for the API class 
#     def self.get_players
#         url = "https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/players"
#         response = HTTParty.get(url)
#         response["data"].each do |p| 
        
#           first_name = p["first_name"]
#           last_name = p["last_name"]  
#         end  
#     end 
# end  

This is the code for the cli class 

# def call 
#     puts "Welcome to SportsNmore!" 
#     puts "Which NBA player would you like to look up?"
#     input = gets.chomp.downcase
#     SportsNmore::API.get_players
# end 
# end
